\title{1200 baud AFSK Demodulation: A cheap solution to hardware TNCs}
\author{Robert Campbell}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In amateur radio APRS had evolved, but it like many other things in the
amateur radio community continues to lag behind current times, not taking
full advantage of new technologies. The goal here is to introduce a new
software suite that makes the decoding of APRS packets more reliable and
at a cheap price. Having hardware TNCs can be a very expensive barrier to
entry, but already having a computer is pretty common these days.
