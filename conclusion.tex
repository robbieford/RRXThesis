This research has proved and presented several demodulation techniques that do not seem to have been considered when doing software based demodulation previously on APRS. Most importantly, the premise that software based demodulators are not as good as the hardware ones holds meaning that there is still the potential for work to be done on the software based demodulators in order to increase the number of successfully decoded packets to compete even closer with hardware. The project also further demonstrates that decoding in software is not a limitation, but can be further refined.
