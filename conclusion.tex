\chapter{Conclusion}
This research set out to try and prove that software could do AX.25 demodulation better than the hardware. Depending on perspective, it may have done so. However, at the very least the research shows that there are many ways to approach the challenge of demodulating these packets and presents the relative performance of over 10 software based approaches and 12 dedicated hardware approaches, whether that hardware is an OpenTracker or TNC.

In the end, the software did do better than the average result using hardware, but in the primary benchmarking file, software was only able to decode 975 packets as opposed to the 1007 that the best piece of hardware detected. Exploring some of the items in the future work section such as using the checksum for forward error correction may be able to get software to the same level as hardware, as it is close.
