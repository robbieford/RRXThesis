New Organization
 1. Introduction
   The goal of this research is to look into new software based demodulation
   techniques using Toledo's javaAX25
 2. Origins of ax.25
   - HDLC
   - Bell 202 (AX.25?)
   - FSK, AFSK, Radio-teletype (RTTY)
   - Really focus on the background information and explain with examples...
      - Bell 202, AFSK, NRZI
 3. Current ax.25 Demodulation Approaches
   - TNCs
   - Problems with the current approach(es)
      - Focus on specific deficiencies
   - Other information about the current state of the art
 4. Algorithmic Demodulation Approaches
   - Zero Crossing
   - DFT
   - Correlation
   - PLL
   - Advantages of signal Derivative
      DC offset & emphasis
 5. Demodulation Benchmarking
   - Audio File generation
   - LA test suite
 6. Demodulation Challenges
         white noise...
         emphasis
 7. Using Sivan Toledo's javax25 package for software based demodulation
   - Reasons for choosing the javaAX25 package
      Background information, talk about output...?
         Peak level
 8. Implementation Details
   - More analysis to show the problems and challenges
      Discrete sampling vs. continuous signals
   - Say which performed poorly and why and which performed better and why
 9. Testing setup and new testing framework
 10. Results
   - No sense in having a whole section on memory, just note that all approaches
      use less than ____MB. 
 11. Future Work
 12. Conclusion

Notes:
- More charts and graphs the better (only change one thing at a time and show
   progressions illustrate each one of the weaknesses.
- Replace tables with bar graphs
