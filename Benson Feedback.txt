Maybe combine Future Work and Conclusion chapters?
clocking energy discussed in two places, the second time it was mentioned it makes more sense.
Section 5.2 picture showing jostling.
Figure 6.2 might have a better example of the zero crossing jostling
Section 8.3 add a picture?
Section 8.5 picture?

In the beginning of chapter 8 list and catagorieze the techniques maybe switch to 8.1.1...
Two Punchlines, less cost and that the software is better now than before.
Table 9.3 - OT3 Micro uses x demodulation scheme and hence is more susceptible to ____
More comments on the Peak demodulator why did it not get 40, but it could get 200?
Figure 9.4 what packets did it miss, why is it not 40?
Is there a way to link these demodulation techniques to their results. Link chapters 5 and 9. Add a table to show which challenges each technique is most suscptible to.
It matches, but what advantage does it bring...? Talk about time to decode.
